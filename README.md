# Project-14-EV-Market-Segmentation
The global electric vehicle (EV) market is developing at a rapid pace. According to EV volumes, overall electric vehicle reached a global share of 8.3% (including battery electric vehicles [BEVs] and Plug- in hybrid electric vehicles [PHEVs]) in 2021 from 4.2% in 2020 with 6.75 million vehicles on the road. This is an increase of 108% as of 2020. EVs are gaining attention across the globe as they help reduce emissions and depletion of natural resources. The Indian EV market is also evolving fast as close to 0.32 million vehicles were sold in 2021, up 168% YoY. Ongoing electric vehicle adoption in India is based on the Paris agreement to reduce carbon emissions, to improve the air quality in urban areas and reduce oil imports.
Market segmentation becomes a crucial tool for evolving transportation technology such as electric vehicles (EVs) in emerging markets to explore and implement for extensive adoption. EVs adoption is expected to grow phenomenally in near future as low emission and low operating cost vehicle, and thus, it drives a considerable amount of forthcoming academic research curiosity. The main aim of this study is to explore and identify distinct sets of potential buyer segments for EVs based on psychographic, behavioral, and socio-economic characterization by employing an integrated research framework of ‘perceived benefits-attitude-intention’.
