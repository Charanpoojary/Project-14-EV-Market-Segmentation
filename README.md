The global electric vehicle (EV) market is developing at a rapid pace. According to EV volumes, overall electric vehicle reached a global share of 8.3% (including battery electric vehicles [BEVs] and Plug- in hybrid electric vehicles [PHEVs]) in 2021 from 4.2% in 2020 with 6.75 million vehicles on the road. This is an increase of 108% as of 2020. EVs are gaining attention across the globe as they help reduce emissions and depletion of natural resources. The Indian EV market is also evolving fast as close to 0.32 million vehicles were sold in 2021, up 168% YoY. Ongoing electric vehicle adoption in India is based on the Paris agreement to reduce carbon emissions, to improve the air quality in urban areas and reduce oil imports.
